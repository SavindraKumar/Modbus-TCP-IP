2. Read Discrete Inputs
3. Read Input Registers
4. Read Holding Registers
5. Write Single Coil
6. Write Single Holding Registers

This code can be configured by macros defined in mbap_conf.h and mbap_debug.h

Each function code can be enable/disable by macro defined in mbap_conf.h
Debug msg and warning can be controlled macros defined in mbap_debug.h

Modbus data should be intialised before using the stack. This should be done by passing
ModbusData_t structure into mbap_DataInit function.

Received query and length is passed into mbap_ProcessRequest function which gives response length
and copies response into response buffer.
